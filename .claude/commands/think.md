# Deep Think

Think deeply and analytically about: $ARGUMENTS

Do NOT write any code. Focus entirely on reasoning.

## Process

1. **Clarify the problem**: Restate it precisely. Identify hidden assumptions and ambiguities.
2. **Break down**: Decompose into sub-problems or dimensions.
3. **Explore approaches**: List at least 3 different approaches with trade-offs for each.
4. **Evaluate**: Compare approaches on complexity, maintainability, performance, and risk.
5. **Recommend**: Choose the best approach and justify why.

## Output Format

```
## Problem
[Restated problem in one paragraph]

## Key Constraints
- [constraint 1]
- [constraint 2]

## Approaches Considered

### 1. [Approach name]
- **How**: Brief description
- **Pros**: ...
- **Cons**: ...

### 2. [Approach name]
...

### 3. [Approach name]
...

## Recommendation
[Chosen approach with justification]

## Next Steps
- [Actionable step 1]
- [Actionable step 2]
```
